# git cheat-sheet

The git command-line utility has plenty of inconsistencies
http://steveko.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/

A GUI like http://sourcetreeapp.com is often helpful, but staying on the command line usually quicker.
This is a list of the commands I use most frequently, listed by funcional category:

### current state
`git status`					list which (unstaged) files have changed  
`git diff`						list (unstaged) changes to files  
`git log`						list recent commits  


### adding files to repo
`git add fn`					stage file  
`git commit -m 'message'`			commit file  
`git commit -am 'message'`		add/commit all changes from all tracked files (no untracked files) in one go  

### undoing previous actions
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History  
`git reset filename`				unstage file  
`git commit --amend -m 'message'`	alter the last commit (add any staged files, new comment)  
`git reset --soft HEAD^`			undo previous commit, put changes in staging  
`git reset --hard HEAD^`			Undo last commit and all changes  
`git reset --hard HEAD^^`			Undo two (^^) last commits and all changes  
`git checkout -- cats.html index.html`	Undo all changes that were made to files cats.html and index.html  
`git rebase --onto <commit-id>\^ <commit-id> HEAD`	remove specific commit from repository. the \ in \^ is just an escape   char to make zsh play nice and is not necessary if using bash.  

### remote repositories
`git remote add origin git@example.com:example/petshop.git` add a remote repository  
`git push -u origin master`			push current local repo to remote. -u sets it to default for the future  
`git remote -v show`				show the available remote repositories that have been added  
`git pull`						checkout and merge remote changes in one go  
`git fetch origin`						update the local cache of the remote repository  
`git remote -v update`				bring remote refs up to date (and -v show which branches were updated)  
`git status -uno` will tell you whether the branch you are tracking is ahead, behind or has diverged. If it says nothing, the local and remote are the same.  
`git show-branch *master` will show you the commits in all of the branches whose names end in master (eg master and origin/master).  
`git show remote origin`			show local<->remote branch tracking and sync status  


### Examine changes on remote, without pulling them
`git fetch origin`  
`git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline` shows commit messages  
`git diff HEAD..origin/master` shows all changes on remote compared to local HEAD  


### Branches
`git branch`						list currently existing branches  
`git branch [branchname]`			create new branch  
`git checkout branchname`			move to that branch  
`git checkout -b branchname`			create and checkout new branch in one go  
`git branch -d branchname`			remove branch  

#### merging branch back to master
`git checkout master; git merge branchname;`	conditions for fast-forward merge - nothing new on master between branch start/end points  

### branches on remote
`git fetch origin``git branch -r` 		list remote branches (after a fetch)  
`git push origin :branchname`		delete remote branch 'branchname'  
`git remote prune origin`			clean up deleted remote branches (let's say someone else deleted a branch on the remote)  
`git show remote origin`			show local<->remote branch tracking and sync status (duplicate info under "remote repositories")  


#### push local branch to differently named remote branch. Eg Heroku only deploys master
`git push heroku yourbranch:master`       simple form  
`git push heroku-staging staging:master` 	(localBranchName:remoteBranchName)  

### tagging
`git tag`	list all tags  
`git checkout v0.0.1`	checkout code  
`git tag -a v0.0.3`	-m 'Version 0.0.3'	add new tag  
`git push --tags`	push new tags to remote  

### dealing with large files - keep them outside the repo on an ssh machine.

`git annex add mybigfile`  
`git commit -m 'add mybigfile'`  
`git push myremote` 
`git annex copy --to myremote mybigfile` this command copies the actual content to myremote  
`git annex drop mybigfile`  remove content from local repo  
`git annex get mybigfile`   retrieve the content  
`git annex copy --from myremote mybigfile`specify the remote from which to get the file
